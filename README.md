N.B: Github only contains source code, if you wish to contribute through other means, make an issue and detail your changes as well as a link to a model containing your changes.

Sword Admin is a project intended to make small changes to your game, such as ban players or adjust someones walkspeed, but Sword Admin for Professionals gives admins more power over their games, with an easy-to-use terminal input. If you wish to use the original, you can find it [here](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/sword-admin-commands/1553323).

N.B: This is *not* based on the original Sword Admin, it simply shares the name and minimal code.

### Updating
Sword Admin for Professionals does not use the same update system as the original Sword Admin. You will receive automatic updates, however, if you do not re-insert your model, the newer features will automatically use the default settings (or will not be used).
